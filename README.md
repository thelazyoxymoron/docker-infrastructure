# Selfhost docker infrastructure

## Idea behind this repo

Over the years, I've started hosting a lot of services at my domain, purely for my personal use. As the volume has grown, I felt the need to document my entire configuration for better discovery in the future - for me and others. And thus born the need for this project.
